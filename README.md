This is a De-Bruijn graph builder and visualizer. To build a graph for a file containing a nucleotide sequence of a genome, create an instance of the Driver class with three given parameters: the file name, the k value, a boolean for the timed variable, and a boolean for whether or not to include vertex labels. If the timed variable is set to false, a visualization of the graph will be generated (if it is set to true, there will be no visualization).
